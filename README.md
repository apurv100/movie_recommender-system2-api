An open movie recommendation API that has been built using Python and deployed on Heroku. This API is based on the Content-Based Filtering technique used in recommendation systems where we recommend items to a user based on the input item's attributes. We have more than 6000 movies present in our dataset and our recommendation algorithm works accordingly.

Use this api while building your application and recommend movies to user accordingly
