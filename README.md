An open movie recommendation API that has been built using Python and deployed on Heroku. This API is based on the Content-Based Filtering technique used in recommendation systems where we recommend items to a user based on the input item's attributes. We have more than 6000 movies present in our dataset and our recommendation algorithm works accordingly.
